========= introduction =========
label{chp:intro}

Mechpy was created for few reasons.
 * To provide the practicing engineer with applications or boilerplate code to quickly replicate and solve real-world systems common in mechanical engineering
 * To give the engineering student a code base from which to supplement learning through hand-calculations and an easy way to check work.

There are many different tools available to engineers. Hand-calculations, spreadsheets, and code are all great ways to perform calculations or visualize data or concepts. MATLAB is the defacto tool to solve many engineering calculations, but is just too expensive to be a practical tool for many of us. Octave, Scilab, or Freelab are great alternatives, but is limited in scope to calculation. I began using python for calculations and visualizations and have found it to be a very powerful tool with many existing modules for mathematics and plotting, in addition to the thousands of other libraries for general computing.

===== abaqus documentation =====

Abaqus uses python as its native macro/scripting language, which makes it easy to develop powerful tools that utilize the robustness and simplicity of the python programming language.

This program was designed to generate a dynamic powerpoint presentation based on a user defined odb file. The `abaqus.py` requires and abaqus license and can be run from the abaqus python console within Abaqus CAE. The `abaqus_report.py` has many other modules that are not allowed in Abaqus python. PythonReportTool calls functions located in the AbaqusReportTool.py and can be run in any python console or windows terminal and can be executed by opening a windows command prompt by.

### Advanced operation
In the python console in Abaqus `>>>` , commands can be typed to use parts of *AbaqusReportTool*. To execute specific functions in *AbaqusReportTool*, type:
!bc pyshell
>>>import os
>>>os.chdir('C:/Users/User1/Directory_with_py_files')
>>>import AbaqusReportTool
>>>odbname='bottle_test/bottle_test.odb'  # odb file cannot have spaces in the name or special characters, just letters, numbers hyphens and underscores!
>>>myOdbTest = AbaqusReportTool.AbaqusReportTool(odbname)
!ec
When myOdbTest is loaded, a check is made to determine if the database needs updated, and does so if it does. Also, *>>>* indicates we are in the python console. and will be dropped henceforth

=== A few examples of how to run individual functions ===
!bc pycod
# to see all the functions available
dir(myOdbTest)
#['BE_makeReportData', 'BT_makeReportData', 'CBE_makeReportData', 'HS_makeReportData', 'TL_makeReportData', 'VP_edit', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__doc__', '__format__', '__getattribute__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__module__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'avi_save', 'clearFiles', 'clearFilesExcept', 'csv_field', 'csv_history', 'csysCyn', 'getMaxField', 'myAssembly', 'myOdb', 'myOdbDat', 'myOdbDat2', 'myOdbVis', 'myOdbs', 'myView', 'myVp', 'png_save', 'png_undeformed', 'replaceElementSets', 'replaceNodeSets', 'rpt_field', 'txt_field_summary', 'txt_history_summary', 'txt_odb_summary', 'xplot_field', 'xplot_history', 'xyList_field', 'xyplot_history']

# to change the viewport to default values of the function, s=0, f=0, o='', c='', csys = '', setsKeyword = '',v='Iso1',myLegend = ON, myState=OFF, myMaxValue = 0, myMinValue = 0)
myOdbTest.VP_edit()

# this code will change the current viewport to step 0,frame 0, object Stress, Component S11, coordinate system default, elementsets all, view Iso1, Legend on, State on, maxvalue auto minvalue auto
myOdbTest.VP_edit(s=0, f=0, o='S', c='S11', csys = '', setsKeyword = '',v='Iso1', myLegend = ON, myState=OFF, myMaxValue = 0, myMinValue = 0)

# to clear all files from the directory except odb and pptx where the odb file resides
myOdbTest.clearFilesExcept(['odb','pptx'])

# to create a text file that describes all the fields in the odb file
myOdbTest.txt_field_summary()

# saves a png of the current viewport
myOdbTest.png_save()
!ec

=== Accessing History Region info using the bottle_test example ===
!bc pycod
myOdbTest.myOdbDat.steps.keys()
# ['pressure']
myStep = myOdbTest.myOdbDat.steps['pressure']
myStep.historyRegions.keys()
# ['Node CATGSD_F_SHAMPOO_BOTTLE_END-1.58', 'Node CATGSD_F_SHAMPOO_BOTTLE_END-1.574']
myRegion=myStep.historyRegions['Node CATGSD_F_SHAMPOO_BOTTLE_END-1.58']
myRegion.historyOutputs.keys()
# ['RF1', 'RF2', 'RF3', 'U1', 'U2', 'U3']
myRegion.historyOutputs['RF1'].description
# 'Reaction force'
# returns a nested tuple of time and the RF1 data
myDat = myRegion.historyOutputs['RF1'].data
# inverts the tuple and unpacks myDat into time and myRF1
time, myRF1  = zip(*myDat)
!ec

=== Extracting Field info ===
!bc pycod
myFieldval = myStep.frames[-1].fieldOutputs['U'].values
myU1 = [myFieldval[k].data[0] for k in range(len(myFieldval))]
!ec

===  Closing the database. even though the database is read-only, it is good practice to close the database ===
!bc pycod
myOdbTest.myOdbDat.close()
!ec


=== Installation ===
To install a minimal python, I recommend "miniconda":"http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html" as a package maanger. Once miniconda or  is installed, install these packages by running these commands in a windows console and following the prompts

!bc batch
conda install numpy

pip install scipy matplotlib
# or
conda install matplotlib=1.4.3

pip install pandas
# or
conda install pandas

pip install python-pptx
pip install moviepy
!ec

For developers, I'd recommend a more complete python installation that includes an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

 * "Anaconda":"http://continuum.io/downloads" for Linux and Windows
 * "winpython":"http://winpython.sourceforge.net/" for Windows
 * "python(x,y)":"https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/" for Windows

 * *cae* - model database, contains models and analysis jobs
 * *jnl* - journal python file, all commands necessary to recreate the most current save model database
 * *rec* - recover file contains commands to replicate the version of the model database in memory

files created when a job is submitted
 * *inp* - abaqus config file that is created when a job is submitted. contains all the information necessary to run a analysis
 * *odb* - output database containing results from completed simulation. Use the step module output request manager to choose variables are saved at what rate. viewed in the  viualiation module
 * *lck* - file that protects the odb file when it is current being written to
 * *res* - used to continue an anaylsis that stopped before it was complete. use the step module to specify which analysis steps should write restart information
 * *dat* - printed output from the anaylsis input file processor, as well as printed output of selected results written during the analysis.
 * *msg*  - contains diagnostic or informative messages about the progress of the solution. Control the output in the step module
 * *fil*  - contains selected results from the analysis in a neutral format. that can we read/written for third-party post processing
 * *rpt* - text file generated from probe data for user specific user requested information
 * *ods* - scratch output database file
 * *mdb* - database of the model
 * *sim* - binary file
 * *sta* - summary of job info
 * *lck* - a file that indicates that the odb file is open and cannot be edited if opened by another user

=== Outputs ===
* defaults set in the environment file
*  typical outputs
 * E - strain
 * PE - plastic strain
 * U - displacements and rotations
 * RF - reaction forces
 * CF - concentrated (applied) forces and moments
 * CSTRESS - contact stresses
 * CDISP - contact displacements
 * see Abaqus Scripting User's Guide 5.2 for more info accessing the database


=== Abaqus Scripting User's Guide - 5.2.2 ===
field output
* typically requested for the entire model, often only at selected elements
* used for creating contour, deformed shape, and symbol plots
* Can be used as a source for x-y plots, but history is better
* intended for infrequent requests for large portions of model  data, such as 3d mesh contour plots
* can specify output frequency or time intervals

!bc pycod
import odbAccess
session.odbs[name].steps[name].frames[i].fieldOutputs[name]
# or
sdat=session.odbs['customBeamExample/customBeamExample.odb'].steps['beamLoad'].frames[-1].fieldOutputs['S']
integrationPointData = sdat.getSubset(position=INTEGRATION_POINT)
invariantsData = sdat.validInvariants
!ec


Abaqus Scripting User's Guide - 9.3.2
Field output is intended for infrequent requests for a large portion of the model and can be used to generate contour plots, animations, symbol plots, and displaced shape plots in the Visualization module of Abaqus/CAE. You can also use field output to generate an X–Y data plot. Only complete sets of basic variables (for example, all the stress or strain components) can be requested as field output. Field output is composed of a “cloud of data values” (e.g., stress tensors at each integration point for all elements). Each data value has a location, type, and value. You use the regions defined in the model data, such as an element set, to access subsets of the field output data. Figure 9–3 shows the field output data object model within an output database.

history output
* requested for a small subset of the model
* typically requested at every increment during the anaylsis
* used to generate xy plots by step and time
* example -  the principal stress at a single node at the root of the beam

!bc pycod
import odbAccess
session.odbs[name].steps[name].historyRegions[name]
!ec

Abaqus Scripting User's Guide - 9.3.2
History output is output defined for a single point or for values calculated for a portion of the model as a whole, such as energy. History output is intended for relatively frequent output requests for small portions of the model and can be displayed in the form of X–Y data plots in the Visualization module of Abaqus/CAE. Individual variables (such as a particular stress component) can be requested.
Depending on the type of output expected, a HistoryRegion object can be defined for one of the following:
* a node
* an integration point
* a region
* the whole model

The output from all history requests that relate to a particular point or region is then collected in one HistoryRegion object. Figure 9–4 shows the history output data object model within an output database. In contrast to field output, which is associated with a frame, history output is associated with a step.

======= Intro to python and gotchas =======

To get started, choose the python distribution you want. I would recommend anaconda, which has most of the scientific packages that are needed, but more importantly, comes with a package manager called conda, which will help us update and install new packages and manage environments if we want to use multiple versions of python.
"miniconda":"http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe" is a great open-source lightweight distribution, but I would recommend anaconda":"http://continuum.io/downloads#34" which will install many scientific packages.

Once the install is complete, lets set up our virtual environments with conda. This will allow you to have an isolated environment for different projects. I typically default with the most recent version and create a 2.7 environment.

to check what environments are install type `conda info -e`

To install a full version of python 2.7 with many packages, type `conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda`

In linux activate different environments by
!bc bash
source activate py27
source deactivate
!ec

and in windows
!bc batch
activate py27
deactivate
!ec


It is easy to install new packages with conda or pip
!bc batch
conda install numpy
conda install pandas
conda install pywin32
pip install python-pptx
pip install pyinstaller
pip install moviepy
!ec

Updating 1 packages or all  is just as easy
!bc batch
conda update matplotlib

# or update all
conda update --all
!ec


Since python is a generic computing language, numerical computation was not initially a very high priority, and so there are a few quirks of the python language that may cause some confusion for non-programmers or matlab users. The first is the difference of python version 2.7 and the current suggested version python 3+ (as of 2016). Many legacy packages exist for python 2.7, so it is handy to use, but it is recommended to develop in the current release.

a handy tool to ensure so errors go unnoticed is to import the future module. This will take care of the print function syntax change `print('hi')` and integer division `/`

!bc pycod
from __future__ import print_function, division
!ec

The second is variable assignment. Since every variable in python is an object, we have to copy variables, not just use `=`. for example, to copy a variable

!bc pycod
# CORRECT
from copy import copy
x = 5
y=copy(x)

# WRONG
y=x
!ec


======= Importing Python Modules  =======

When using python, the very first code you will need is to import modules. An example of importing the essential scientific computing libraries with some settings is shown here.

!bc pycod

# setup
import numpy as np
import sympy as sp
import scipy
from pprint import pprint
sp.init_printing(use_latex='mathjax')

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 8)  # (width, height)
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 14
plt.rcParams['legend.fontsize'] = 16
from matplotlib import patches

get_ipython().magic('matplotlib')  # seperate window
get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline') # inline plotting

# or for inline plotting, in an  ipython console, use the magic commands
%matplotlib inline

# to revert to window plotting
%matplotlib
#or
%matplotlib qt
!ec


!split
======= Converting an ipython notebook to an html document =======
Ipython notebooks can eaily be converted to an html file with the following python code

!bc pycod
get_ipython().system('jupyter nbconvert --to html mechpy.ipynb')
!ec

or, in the OS terminal

!bc batch
jupyter nbconvert --to html mechpy.ipynb
!ec

======= Running jupyter notebook in windows =======
In windows, create a batch file (*.bat) to run a jupyter notebook server in the current directory
!bc batch
:: Use to launch jupyter notebooks
:: change console to the current working directory
Pushd "%~dp0"
:: launch jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook
:: write html output
jupyter nbconvert --to html mechpy.ipynb
pause
!ec


======= pasting raw data into python =======

This example shows how you can copy and past data into python

!bc pycod
y = '''62606.53409
59989.34659
62848.01136
80912.28693
79218.03977
81242.1875
59387.27273
73027.5974
69470.69805
66843.99351
82758.44156
81647.72727
77519.96753'''
y = [float(x) for x in np.array(y.replace('\n',',').split(','))]
print(y, end=" ")
!ec

======= silly ascii text plot =======

with sympy
!bc pycod
from sympy import symbols, exp, pi, cos
from sympy.plotting import textplot
x = symbols('x')
textplot( exp(-x) * cos(2*pi*x)  ,0,5, 75,20)
!ec

with scitools
!bc pycod
# This is the same example as in the scitools.aplotter doc string

import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(0, 5, 81)
#y = np.exp(-0.5*x**2)*np.cos(np.pi*x)
y=np.exp(-x)*np.cos(2*np.pi*x)
from scitools.aplotter import plot
plot(x, y)

plot(x, y, draw_axes=False)

# Plot symbols (the dot argument) at data points
plot(x, y, plot_slope=False)

# Drop axis labels
plot(x, y, plot_labels=False)

plot(x, y, dot='o', plot_slope=False)

# Store plot in a string
p = plot(x, y, output=str)
print p
!ec
